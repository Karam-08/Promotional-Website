            <h2>Information</h2>
            <p>It all started when the owner Nathan looked at the ingredients list for gum. He saw the term "gum base" and did his research.
                He saw that the gum base has rubber, plastics, and flavor modifiers.
                Nathan then asked himself "what if there was a gum that actually healed your teeth?".
                He eventually created a gum that remineralizes your teeth and kills bad bacteria.
                The gum itself has a base of mastic, spruce, and chicle. These were saps that were chewed on centuries ago, and research shows that they have healing properties.
                The gum also has nano-hydroxyapatite. Hydroxyapatite is an essential mineral found in teeth. The nano-hydroxyapatite helps to remineralize and strengthens the tooth enamel.
